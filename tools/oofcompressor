# this is a simple script that compresses folders that are auto-downloaded to,
# then moves the compressed versions into a compress folder.
# It should only compress new items
# it does this by comparing the download folder to the compress folder and compresses any missing items
# this gets called by the main script

# this is important because even though the command runs from a shell, and the script runs fine when manually started,
# it still partially fails in cron because youtube-dl can't find ffmpeg. The other part to this is setting the PATH in cron.
# I haven't tested whether it is necessary to have this both here and in cron
