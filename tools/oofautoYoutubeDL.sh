#!/bin/bash

# this is a simple script that downloads entire specified playlists
# this should be run with cron or on a schedule
# this should only download items not previously downloaded, so be careful to leave already downloaded
# videos in place or they will be re-downloaded the next time the script is run

# this will download any new playlist additions into a source video folder, then log what it did every time it runs.
# It also keeps track of how long it took.

# to run this script with cron, we have to remind it where it can find youtube-dl and ffmpeg
# this is important because even though the command runs from a shell, and the script runs fine when manually started,
# it still partially fails in cron because youtube-dl can't find ffmpeg. The other part to this is setting the PATH in cron.
# I haven't tested whether it is necessary to have this both here and in cron
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
export DISPLAY=:0.0
ffmpeg=/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
echo "current folder is"
