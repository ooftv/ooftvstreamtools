# run command 10 times

# this relies on gshuf which is not installed natively on a mac. can be installed with brew install coreutils

# this uses tee to send the output to two files, one named for the date (for records) and one simply overwrites the playlist called today.m3u
# obs (or whatever streamer you want) will just always point to the file called today.m3u which will be refreshed everytime the script is run
